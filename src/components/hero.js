            I am a dedicated and results-driven Product Manager with a passion
            for bringing innovative products to life. My journey in product
            management is marked by a blend of strategic thinking, technical
            expertise, and a commitment to user-centered design. I have two
            years experience creating interactive experiences for amazing people
            using modern frontend frameworks like reactjs and building
            functional web applications. While pursuing my Master's degree in
            management, I honed my leadership, strategic thinking, team
            management, analytical and problem-solving abilities. My
            professional journey began as an Intern Product Manager at HNG
            Internship 11, where I gained hands-on experience in creating
            product require documents (prd) for a boilerplate and
            product(Youtube summarizer), functional requirement document,
            creating tickets for a MVP, user research, feature prioritization,
            and competitive analysis. My expertise includes strategic planning,
            user-centered design, agile methodologies, and market analysis. I
            excel at managing project lifecycles from initiation to user
            adoption and collaborating with cross-functional teams in dynamic
            environments to achieve optimal results that drive product
            excellence and enhance financial profitability.
